                            This website was designed for the purpose of analyzing written text and providing feedback to users regarding the “movement” of the argument in their writing. It was created as an improved, empowering alternative to “<a href="http://writersdiet.com/test.php" target="_blank">The Writer’s Diet Test</a>,” a test that rates the success of writing by employing language that stems from common misconceptions and accusatory thought. “The Writer’s Diet Test” presents its findings by ranking components on a scale progressing from lean, to fit and trim, to needs toning, to flabby, and lastly to heart attack. A more accurate scale would begin with malnourished as a starting point rather than lean. We sought to avoid this scale entirely, however, as it equates heart attack to obesity while implying that one has complete control over these circumstances. Our website, on the other hand, aims to address writing with a more accurate, knowledgeable, and empowering scale. The Writer’s Plate implements a rhetoric that draws parallels between a balanced meal and the balanced use of directional indicators within writing.

                            The Writer’s Plate is an automated tool that provides feedback on the user’s writing based on the use of directional indicators. Directional indicators are words that direct the flow of thought in writing. There are four kinds including additive, sequential, causal, and oppositional terms. A well-written paper includes a healthy balance of each kind because the absence or excess of a given type hinders the flow of the writer’s argument. In academic writing, exercising the use of causal and oppositional terms improves a sentence or paragraph. Casual terms include words such as therefore, consequently, and as a result. Oppositional terms are words that demonstrate contrasting thoughts or ideas. Some examples include however, yet, and despite. Our test ascertains the number of causal and oppositional terms and compares them with the use of additive and sequential terms. Additive terms are very often overused in writing. They lead to repetition within text and limit the flow of an argument. Some examples include and, in addition, also, and along with. Sequential terms indicate order with words like first, next, and last. An excessive number of this form of directional indicator can make a paper sound more like an outline than a finished text. As our test examines each directional indicator, it compares the abundance of each type. The test then provides feedback comparing the current and ideal proportion on directional indicator types within the text. Another useful tool our test provides is our “Bland and Flavorful Indicator” result chart. We included this aspect within our results in an effort to promote thoughtful and creative wording from our users. In essence, this part of the test categorizes “bland” indicators as words like and or also. In contrast, words such as furthermore and despite are categorized as “flavorful”. It is our goal to provide users with a tool that assists them in their writing process by elucidating the areas of their writing which most need improvement to maximize the flow and effectiveness of the argument within their work.

                            Overall, our tool uses an asset based approach to giving feedback on their writing. It praises by pointing out where sophisticated transitions were used and also highlights areas that need improvement by pointing out the number of more basic transitions are used.
